Blender_IMGFromClipboard
Quickly add images to Blender from Clipboard.

It adds a new entry under Shift+A → IMGFromClipboard, where you can choose to import the clipboard image as either a Reference (Image Empty) or a Mesh (a plane with the image applied as a material).
Every imported image is automatically saved to a persistent temp folder (Blender_IMGFromClipboard) so it won’t get lost unless you delete it manually. Tested with Blender 5.0.1.

Installation:
Just go to preferences and install 'Blender_IMGFromClipboard.py' from disk.
